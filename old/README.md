Project Overview
The Ideal Home Website project was inspired by the need to simplify home customization and smart home integration for homeowners. As technology advances, the ability to control and personalize our living spaces has become more accessible, but the process can still be daunting. We wanted to create a platform that makes it easy for anyone to design their dream home and integrate smart home features seamlessly.

The journey began when we noticed how many homeowners struggled with visualizing changes in their homes and integrating new technologies. Our team, passionate about technology and home improvement, decided to combine our skills to develop a solution. This project is also a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, demonstrating our skills in web development and user experience design.
